              We’re continuing our BWxD 2016 spotlight with Maria Russo, committee co-chair and fan of all things sustainable. Maria is currently in the class of 2018 and thinking about double-concentrating in Urban Studies and Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizations. We asked her a couple questions about how she got interested in Better World, her experience being on the committee, and all things design.

            <p style="font-weight: 700;">
              How did you get interested in BWxD?
            </p>
            <p>
              I was a freshman at Brown and I kept hearing things popping up about Better World, and I started thinking, “This sounds really cool.” I ended up applying on a whim. Last year, I was in charge of Food and Sustainability. I knew how sustainable solutions worked in our world, and I had done a lot on farms that equipped me with those skills.
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;">
              How has it impacted your outlook on design? On your education?
            </p>
            <p>
              It allowed me to see what interdisciplinary design really means. I realized that designers could design our world, and not just design things. This really encouraged me to participate in these conversations about design because I saw that design could be open to different skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Better World’s 2015 mission statement talks about the “tools, lessons, and discoveries” that the conference equips its attendees with. What tools, lessons, and discoveries have you gained from being a part of Better World?
            </p>
            <p>
              These are different for every person, but one lesson I learned about design is that there are no limits. Everyone has something to contribute, and there’s no clear separation between design and other fields and within design itself.
            </p>
            <img class="previewImage" src="images/blog/maria2.png"/>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;">
              What’s your definition of design?
            </p>
            <p>
              To me, design has an important functionality in its intention. It ties in various elements: purpose, aesthetics, and some form of construction. There’s really no concrete definition though.
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;">
              How has BWxD evolved since you’ve been a part of it, and what changes should we look forward to for next year’s conference?
            </p>
            <p>
              Better World has definitely changed physically, meaning that the number of people who know about it and attend has increased dramatically. We are pushing on topics that we haven’t touched upon before, and we hope to continue pushing these boundaries to transform perspectives.

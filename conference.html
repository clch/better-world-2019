                  Tension can be described as the state or condition resulting from opposing applied forces. This definition can be extended to refer to a strained relationship between conflicting ideas, entities, or people. We have chosen the theme of Tensions as an opportunity to reflect upon recent social, political, environmental, and technological challenges and their implications for design practices. 
                </div>
                <div class="introContent">
                  At today’s crossroads, interdisciplinary and collaborative problem-solving is more important than ever. Together, we will consider innovative possibilities for creating personal, local, and global impact, with a focus on counteracting inequality and amplifying historically underrepresented voices. We hope to bring together a diverse community of designers, activists, artists, scientists, writers, scholars, and more to investigate how these different Tensions shape their work and inform their design decisions.

                    This talk will explore Agency—Agency’s speculative and built work at the intersection of architecture, infrastructure and the environment that open up alternative possibilities and agency for design. It will focus on recent work that deals with, for example, water infrastructure, non-profit community design and public space.

                    If design is going to deliver on its promise and play a part in solving some of the world's most complex challenges, we need to reimagine the role of the designer. Once the ringmaster, it's time to rethink the designer as protagonist approach, upend existing power dynamics, and share agency and protagonism with those affected by the very challenges we hope to address. Come dive into the issues of power, identity, and protagonism in design, hear examples of how these elements play out in our work at The Studio, and explore what this means for your own role, work, and career.

Healthcare in the United States is: lifesaving, expensive, mostly closed, inaccessible, and inequitable. In short, it is riddled with tensions and questions. How did our healthcare system get to be the way it is today? What potential does human-centered design have to reorient how patients, caregivers, and providers experience healthcare? What are the macro factors that shape the reality of healthcare? How can healthcare designers better promote health equity through community partnerships? Join our three panelists, Jeremy Beaudry, Samantha Dempsey, and Juhan Sonin, as they discuss these questions and propose their own conclusion on how we crawl out of this situation.

                  Like much of the US, New York City has a voter engagement problem. The city and its state consistently rank low in voter turnout, with abysmal participation in local elections. Income, education, and age commonly divide neighborhoods who vote from those who don’t. The Vote Local campaign is a collaboration between Once–Future Office, AIGA NY, Community Votes, and United Neighborhood Houses to support and strengthen voter engagement in underserved communities around NYC. As part of AIGA’s Design for Democracy initiative, Once–Future Office led a participatory design process in which designers, advocacy organizations, and communities unite to increase voter registration and turnout.

                    If design is going to deliver on its promise and play a part in solving some of the world's most complex challenges, we need to reimagine the role of the designer. Once the ringmaster, it's time to rethink the designer as protagonist approach, upend existing power dynamics, and share agency and protagonism with those affected by the very challenges we hope to address. Come dive into the issues of power, identity, and protagonism in design, hear examples of how these elements play out in our work at The Studio, and explore what this means for your own role, work, and career.

                    There is a movement in cities across the world to reclaim underutilized infrastructure and re-imagine it as public space. Drawing upon lessons from the High Line as well as a range of other industrial reuse projects, this presentation will explore the tensions between people, nature, and infrastructure---and how to design processes that transcend these tensions in order to create vibrant, equitable, and inclusive public spaces.

                  In this discussion recent graduates of the School of VIsual Arts MFA in Design for Social Innovation program, facilitated by Cheryl Heller the founding chair of the program, will present their MFA thesis projects and reflect upon the tensions that arise while designing for social impact.<br/><br/>

                  Below are brief descriptions of each of the presenter’s projects:<br/><br/>

                   <b>Jessie Silver: Just Ask </b><br/>  
                  How can the design of health clinics inside jails improve people’s ability to give and receive healthcare?Jessie will present and reflect on a year of collaborative work, based inside jails, that surfaced catalytic design solutions by patients and providers themselves.  <br/><br/>

                   <b>Amanda Finuccio: Mom’s Make Books </b><br/>
                  In every project there are two stories: Story A is the story about the community you collaborate with—the design process you explore together and what you create in response to what you learn and understand about the challenge at hand. Story B is the story about the collaboration that takes place with yourself—how do you design for the stake you have in your work?<br/><br/>

                   <b>Maria Sandolva and Nicholas Chan: The MakeGuffin Project </b><br/>
                  Improving social service delivery demands confronting our own biases; shifting focus from the diagnosis, to the passions of the humans behind the stigma. The MakeGuffin Project is a program for and by individuals on the Autism spectrum.<br/><br/>

                   <b>Hrudaya Veena Yanamandala and Stephen Morrison: Headway, A Survivors’ Guide to Survivorship </b><br/>
                  The project involved working and designing closely with Cancer Survivors, the process of conducting Human Centered Design within healthcare. Through the talk we uncover the tensions of designing within the field of healthcare in the United States.<br/><br/>

                    Join us for From the Field, a monthly career conversation series with some of the best social impact designers from around the globe. Live this month from Better World x Design, Jessica Mason (The Social Impact Studio) will sit down to chat with Sabrina Dorsainvil (Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics) to talk about her work and her take on what it means to be a designer in today’s complex world. Intended for early-career designers, those transitioning into the sector, and lifelong learners, we will crowd-source questions in advance and also have open Q&A during the conversation to create an exchange rich with insights about crafting a fulfilling career that puts public good squarely at the center.

                    is there love in a virtual embrace? do more ‘likes’ make your feelings more real or less? as we increasingly store our memories on the Internet, it seems increasingly difficult to convey who we are without pulling out our Instagram account.

                    in this workshop, we will reflect on our relationship with technology and how it shapes our digital self, unpack the underlying tensions, and create emotional tools for our true self.

                    There is no greater tension than the gap between the change we need to create in the world and what we are currently doing to create it. Cheryl Heller will discuss social design’s potential in alleviating that tension, and provide lessons from her new book. The Intergalactic Design Guide: Harnessing the Creative Potential of Social Design.

                    This lecture explores the emergent socio-ecological solutions that make a direct impact on our dynamically altered atmosphere. It’s a compilation of advanced research that reviews concepts in the art of biotechnology from insect food sourcing to fungi building components in cities across the globe. Stemming from work initially developed in the non-profit research group Terreform ONE, this talk disseminates ecologically intelligent design in various speculative urban contexts. As novel investigations, they are derived from the effective techniques explored within the joint territory of design and synthetic biology. Ultimately for architects and their education, it ought to be almost indistinguishable from lessons in biology. Admittedly, the agency of architecture has yet to achieve this union. Our aim is to push the theoretical nature/design boundary until it becomes permanently fused.

                    How can immersive storyscapes and interaction be used to make the world a better place? Look directly into the eyes of the people that police brutality is happening to everyday on the streets of our nation. Remember the journey of a family forced to flee their homeland because of ethnic cleansing into the largest refugee camp on the planet. Trigger memories inside your DNA - remembering your innate connection to the earth. Will these immersive storyscapes change behavior, encourage action, and make change? We think so.

                  This interactive, participatory workshop will explore the concept of language justice - as a framework and in its application in our social practice. It will also explore language and language dominance as tools for the creation, destruction, and re-construction of social, cultural, physical, and political spaces in a multilingual society. This workshop will be bilingual in English/Spanish, with simultaneous interpretation.

                    Design Thinking is a design-inspired creative process that can be applied in any sector. It's a powerful force for change but can also be exclusive, rife with uneven power dynamics, and an actor in reproducing oppressive outcomes. But what if we could leverage the power of design thinking and systems thinking to create change towards social justice? What if we viewed activists, nurses, teachers, parents and children as designers for social justice? Come learn about the emerging grassroots movement called Equity Design, the designers experimenting on the cutting edge, and the ways we are adapting the process and tools. Tania, a founding member of the Equity Design movement, will be sharing her equity design process, Liberatory Design, in addition to others in the field. No previous knowledge of design thinking required to attend.

                    For 17 years, Wikipedia has collected free knowledge from around the world. Our culture is collaborative: volunteers share what they know and trust others to do they same. But in emerging internet markets like India, Iraq, and Nigeria, there is little participation in Wikipedia. People have never even heard of the website. I decided to collaborate directly with volunteers in each country, inspiring marketing I would have never considered alone.

                  In 2011, Garden Time was formed to build a garden at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Working with a group of incarcerated men in the maximum-security facility, the non-profit transformed an empty section of prison yard into a flower- and vegetable-producing garden. Since then, two more gardens have been built within the prison complex, and inmates have learned to prepare soil, plant seeds, tend the garden, and gather the harvest. Through the Garden Time program, they have become skilled gardeners, producing thousands of pounds of produce for use in the prison kitchens. More importantly, they have gained self-confidence, a positive outlook, and a stronger connection to the natural world. From practical concerns about hot pepper varieties and tomato stakes to the larger questions of whether all humans deserve a productive life, Garden Time co-founder and Executive Director Kate Lacouture discusses the fundamental act of growing food in prison and the personal and societal tensions underlying their work.

                    Fashion is not rational, but a passion, and as such it thrives on rivalry, exclusion and injustice. And while we are taught that surface should not matter, our clothes are highly contested membranes between social realms, as much canvases for aspirations as windows of vulnerability. Yet, designers are mainly taught to think of fashion as aesthetic commodities, and fail to see the dynamic of psychosocial tensions and conflicts that energizes fashion in the first place. This presentation will unpack some of these tensions and finish with a discussion and workshop.

                    Working in communities as an outsider/designer can be hugely rewarding and endlessly challenging. Based on experiences working as a design consultant in indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon and as a textile designer in the field of global health, Eliza shares lessons learned from the perspective of the "community guest".

                    At first glance, storytelling appears to come into tension with modern healthcare practice: anecdote versus datasets, rapport-building versus time constraints, personal experience versus medical expertise. But what happens if we reframe these tensions as opportunities to make healthcare more effective, collaborative, and equitable? In this mini-workshop, you will contribute to an emerging framework that describes storytelling’s applications in healthcare and learn tools to help people connect through stories. Whether you work at the intersection of design and health, have had personal experiences with the healthcare system, or just want to dive deeper into storytelling as a design modality, come explore the power of story with us.

                    The Service Design Studio under the New York City Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity is the first-ever municipal design studio in the country with a mission to make public services more effective and accessible for all New Yorkers. The Studio was founded to spread valuable design methodologies that are often underutilized inside government. In this talk, you will learn more about who we are, what we do and how we work closely with partnering agencies to apply service design towards improving social services. We’ll share stories of the challenges and successes of working inside the belly of the beast and have a conversation about why designers are imperative to approaching programs and service solutions in a more holistic and dignified way.

                  Like many creatives, I process life differently. I was born painfully shy, felt detached from my body and was afraid of everything, including my own imagination. I used art-making as an escape hatch. Then, when I had to choose a vocation, I chose design. Since then, I have used design to make art, products, fashion, a living — and, to problem solve — to take the tension that was so tightly wound inside of me, and create order that has provided me with freedom and a fascinating international career.

                  On Protest, Art and Activism is an exhibition series in the Cohen Gallery at Granoff Center for the Creative Arts on the Brown University campus that explores differing ways artists engage the political and social issues of their time. Part 1 of the series features works by Ja’Tovia Gary, Theaster Gates, Josephine Meckseper and Dread Scott, and examines how artists use histories of protest to create artworks in response to contemporary activism and ongoing struggles. The works included here collapse temporal distance, finding solidarity and continuity between past and present civil rights and anti-war activism. The exhibition will be on view from October 1, 2018 - December 15, 2018. <br/><br/>


As part of the Better World by Design 2018 Conference, there will be a special exhibition preview and workshop on Sunday, September 30th from 4:30 - 5:30 pm, facilitated by Sydney Skybetter.<br/><br/>


On Protest, Art & Activism is presented by David Winton Bell Gallery and Brown Arts Initiative.<br/><br/>

                      If design is going to deliver on its promise and play a part in solving some of the world's most complex challenges, we need to reimagine the role of the designer. Once the ringmaster, it's time to rethink the designer as protagonist approach, upend existing power dynamics, and share agency and protagonism with those affected by the very challenges we hope to address. Come dive into the issues of power, identity, and protagonism in design, hear examples of how these elements play out in our work at The Studio, and explore what this means for your own role, work, and career.<br/><br/>

Healthcare in the United States is: lifesaving, expensive, mostly closed, inaccessible, and inequitable. In short, it is riddled with tensions and questions. How did our healthcare system get to be the way it is today? What potential does human-centered design have to reorient how patients, caregivers, and providers experience healthcare? What are the macro factors that shape the reality of healthcare? How can healthcare designers better promote health equity through community partnerships? Join our three panelists, Jeremy Beaudry, Samantha Dempsey, and Juhan Sonin, as they discuss these questions and propose their own conclusion on how we crawl out of this situation.<br/><br/>

                      Like much of the US, New York City has a voter engagement problem. The city and its state consistently rank low in voter turnout, with abysmal participation in local elections. Income, education, and age commonly divide neighborhoods who vote from those who don’t. The Vote Local campaign is a collaboration between Once–Future Office, AIGA NY, Community Votes, and United Neighborhood Houses to support and strengthen voter engagement in underserved communities around NYC. As part of AIGA’s Design for Democracy initiative, Once–Future Office led a participatory design process in which designers, advocacy organizations, and communities unite to increase voter registration and turnout. <br/><br/>

                      If design is going to deliver on its promise and play a part in solving some of the world's most complex challenges, we need to reimagine the role of the designer. Once the ringmaster, it's time to rethink the designer as protagonist approach, upend existing power dynamics, and share agency and protagonism with those affected by the very challenges we hope to address. Come dive into the issues of power, identity, and protagonism in design, hear examples of how these elements play out in our work at The Studio, and explore what this means for your own role, work, and career.<br/><br/>

                      There is a movement in cities across the world to reclaim underutilized infrastructure and re-imagine it as public space. Drawing upon lessons from the High Line as well as a range of other industrial reuse projects, this presentation will explore the tensions between people, nature, and infrastructure---and how to design processes that transcend these tensions in order to create vibrant, equitable, and inclusive public spaces.<br/><br/>

                       In this discussion recent graduates of the School of VIsual Arts MFA in Design for Social Innovation program, facilitated by Cheryl Heller the founding chair of the program, will present their MFA thesis projects and reflect upon the tensions that arise while designing for social impact.<br/><br/>

Below are brief descriptions of each of the presenter’s projects:<br/><br/>

 <b>Jessie Silver: Just Ask  </b> <br/>
How can the design of health clinics inside jails improve people’s ability to give and receive healthcare?Jessie will present and reflect on a year of collaborative work, based inside jails, that surfaced catalytic design solutions by patients and providers themselves. <br/><br/>

 <b>Amanda Finuccio: Mom’s Make Books </b><br/>
In every project there are two stories: Story A is the story about the community you collaborate with—the design process you explore together and what you create in response to what you learn and understand about the challenge at hand. Story B is the story about the collaboration that takes place with yourself—how do you design for the stake you have in your work?<br/><br/>

 <b>Maria Sandolva and Nicholas Chan: The MakeGuffin Project </b><br/>
Improving social service delivery demands confronting our own biases; shifting focus from the diagnosis, to the passions of the humans behind the stigma. The MakeGuffin Project is a program for and by individuals on the Autism spectrum.<br/><br/>

 <b>Hrudaya Veena Yanamandala and Stephen Morrison: Headway, A Survivors’ Guide to Survivorship </b><br/>
The project involved working and designing closely with Cancer Survivors, the process of conducting Human Centered Design within healthcare. Through the talk we uncover the tensions of designing within the field of healthcare in the United States.<br/><br/>

                      Join us for From the Field, a monthly career conversation series with some of the best social impact designers from around the globe. Live this month from Better World x Design, Jessica Mason (The Social Impact Studio) will sit down to chat with Sabrina Dorsainvil (Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics) to talk about her work and her take on what it means to be a designer in today’s complex world. Intended for early-career designers, those transitioning into the sector, and lifelong learners, we will crowd-source questions in advance and also have open Q&A during the conversation to create an exchange rich with insights about crafting a fulfilling career that puts public good squarely at the center.<br/><br/>

                      There is no greater tension than the gap between the change we need to create in the world and what we are currently doing to create it. Cheryl Heller will discuss social design’s potential in alleviating that tension, and provide lessons from her new book.

                      This lecture explores the emergent socio-ecological solutions that make a direct impact on our dynamically altered atmosphere. It’s a compilation of advanced research that reviews concepts in the art of biotechnology from insect food sourcing to fungi building components in cities across the globe. Stemming from work initially developed in the non-profit research group Terreform ONE, this talk disseminates ecologically intelligent design in various speculative urban contexts. As novel investigations, they are derived from the effective techniques explored within the joint territory of design and synthetic biology. Ultimately for architects and their education, it ought to be almost indistinguishable from lessons in biology. Admittedly, the agency of architecture has yet to achieve this union. Our aim is to push the theoretical nature/design boundary until it becomes permanently fused.<br/><br/>

                      How can immersive storyscapes and interaction be used to make the world a better place? Look directly into the eyes of the people that police brutality is happening to everyday on the streets of our nation. Remember the journey of a family forced to flee their homeland because of ethnic cleansing into the largest refugee camp on the planet. Trigger memories inside your DNA - remembering your innate connection to the earth. Will these immersive storyscapes change behavior, encourage action, and make change? We think so.<br/><br/>

                      Design Thinking is a design-inspired creative process that can be applied in any sector. It's a powerful force for change but can also be exclusive, rife with uneven power dynamics, and an actor in reproducing oppressive outcomes. But what if we could leverage the power of design thinking and systems thinking to create change towards social justice? What if we viewed activists, nurses, teachers, parents and children as designers for social justice? Come learn about the emerging grassroots movement called Equity Design, the designers experimenting on the cutting edge, and the ways we are adapting the process and tools. Tania, a founding member of the Equity Design movement, will be sharing her equity design process, Liberatory Design, in addition to others in the field. No previous knowledge of design thinking required to attend.<br/><br/>

                      For 17 years, Wikipedia has collected free knowledge from around the world. Our culture is collaborative: volunteers share what they know and trust others to do they same. But in emerging internet markets like India, Iraq, and Nigeria, there is little participation in Wikipedia. People have never even heard of the website. I decided to collaborate directly with volunteers in each country, inspiring marketing I would have never considered alone.

                      In 2011, Garden Time was formed to build a garden at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Working with a group of incarcerated men in the maximum-security facility, the non-profit transformed an empty section of prison yard into a flower- and vegetable-producing garden. Since then, two more gardens have been built within the prison complex, and inmates have learned to prepare soil, plant seeds, tend the garden, and gather the harvest. Through the Garden Time program, they have become skilled gardeners, producing thousands of pounds of produce for use in the prison kitchens. More importantly, they have gained self-confidence, a positive outlook, and a stronger connection to the natural world. From practical concerns about hot pepper varieties and tomato stakes to the larger questions of whether all humans deserve a productive life, Garden Time co-founder and Executive Director Kate Lacouture discusses the fundamental act of growing food in prison and the personal and societal tensions underlying their work.<br/><br/>

                      Fashion is not rational, but a passion, and as such it thrives on rivalry, exclusion and injustice. And while we are taught that surface should not matter, our clothes are highly contested membranes between social realms, as much canvases for aspirations as windows of vulnerability. Yet, designers are mainly taught to think of fashion as aesthetic commodities, and fail to see the dynamic of psychosocial tensions and conflicts that energizes fashion in the first place. This presentation will unpack some of these tensions and finish with a discussion and workshop.<br/><br/>

                      At first glance, storytelling appears to come into tension with modern healthcare practice: anecdote versus datasets, rapport-building versus time constraints, personal experience versus medical expertise. But what happens if we reframe these tensions as opportunities to make healthcare more effective, collaborative, and equitable? In this mini-workshop, you will contribute to an emerging framework that describes storytelling’s applications in healthcare and learn tools to help people connect through stories. Whether you work at the intersection of design and health, have had personal experiences with the healthcare system, or just want to dive deeper into storytelling as a design modality, come explore the power of story with us.<br/><br/>

                      The Service Design Studio under the New York City Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity is the first-ever municipal design studio in the country with a mission to make public services more effective and accessible for all New Yorkers. The Studio was founded to spread valuable design methodologies that are often underutilized inside government. In this talk, you will learn more about who we are, what we do and how we work closely with partnering agencies to apply service design towards improving social services. We’ll share stories of the challenges and successes of working inside the belly of the beast and have a conversation about why designers are imperative to approaching programs and service solutions in a more holistic and dignified way.<br/><br/>

                      Like many creatives, I process life differently. I was born painfully shy, felt detached from my body and was afraid of everything, including my own imagination. I used art-making as an escape hatch. Then, when I had to choose a vocation, I chose design. Since then, I have used design to make art, products, fashion, a living — and, to problem solve — to take the tension that was so tightly wound inside of me, and create order that has provided me with freedom and a fascinating international career.<br/><br/>

                      On Protest, Art and Activism is an exhibition series in the Cohen Gallery at Granoff Center for the Creative Arts on the Brown University campus that explores differing ways artists engage the political and social issues of their time. Part 1 of the series features works by Ja’Tovia Gary, Theaster Gates, Josephine Meckseper and Dread Scott, and examines how artists use histories of protest to create artworks in response to contemporary activism and ongoing struggles. The works included here collapse temporal distance, finding solidarity and continuity between past and present civil rights and anti-war activism. The exhibition will be on view from October 1, 2018 - December 15, 2018. <br/><br/>


                      As part of the Better World by Design 2018 Conference, there will be a special exhibition preview and workshop on Sunday, September 30th from 4:30 - 5:30 pm, facilitated by Sydney Skybetter.<br/><br/>


                      On Protest, Art & Activism is presented by David Winton Bell Gallery and Brown Arts Initiative.<br/><br/>

Since then, she has helped develop financial inclusion and environmental conservation projects.

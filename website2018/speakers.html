                <div class="introContent">
                  Tension can be described as the state or condition resulting from opposing applied forces. This definition can be extended to refer to a strained relationship between conflicting ideas, entities, or people. We have chosen the theme of Tensions as an opportunity to reflect upon recent social, political, environmental, and technological challenges and their implications for design practices. 
                </div>
                <div class="introContent">
                  At today’s crossroads, interdisciplinary and collaborative problem-solving is more important than ever. Together, we will consider innovative possibilities for creating personal, local, and global impact, with a focus on counteracting inequality and amplifying historically underrepresented voices. We hope to bring together a diverse community of designers, activists, artists, scientists, writers, scholars, and more to investigate how these different Tensions shape their work and inform their design decisions.

                    Lori Lobenstine is the Program Design Lead and Co-Founder of the Design Studio for Social Intervention (DS4SI). She grew up in a family of community and union organizers, and decided early on that working with youth was her passion and her route to creating change, including in settings as diverse as classrooms, basketball courts, museums and foreign countries.
